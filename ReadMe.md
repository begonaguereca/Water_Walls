# Water Walls 

On the client, create a form that's centered vertically and horizontally in the page.
This form accepts a string and submits it to the server.
On the server, the string is sorted lexicographically in descending order.
Back on the client, display a table of each submitted string and its sorted version.

## Getting Started

Clone github to your local machine, navigate to the root folder of the directory, then:
npm install
npm start
...then go to http://localhost:3000 on your browser.

### Problem Summary 

We are going to represent a series of walls of different integer heights.

For example, given heights of [5, 3, 7, 2, 6, 4, 5, 9, 1, 2], it would look like this:

Our goal is to determine which two walls have the most water trapped between them, and exactly how much water that is.

Output for the above: [3, 8, 11]...we're using 1 as the first index. This means that between wall #3 and wall #8, there are 11 blocks of water:
